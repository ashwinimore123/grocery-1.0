# grocery
created two endpoints for a grocery inventory management system - a POST endpoint for adding grocery items to the inventory, and a GET endpoint for retrieving all items in the inventory.

Start the Laravel development server:
php artisan serve
The application will be available at (http://localhost/grocery/index)

Access the Grocery Inventory Management UI and test the endpoints.
